Apache Beam =>

An open source, unified model for defining both batch and streaming data-parallel processing pipelines

Using one of the open source Beam SDKs, a program is built that defines the pipeline. The pipeline is then executed by one of Beamâ€™s supported distributed processing back-ends, which include Apache Apex, Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow.
