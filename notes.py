# In parallel computing, an embarrassingly parallel workload or problem (also called perfectly parallel,
# delightfully parallel or pleasingly parallel) is one where little or no effort is needed to separate
# the problem into a number of parallel tasks.[1] This is often the case where there is little or no
# dependency or need for communication between those parallel tasks, or for results between them.

# Beam is particularly useful for Embarrassingly Parallel data processing tasks, in which the problem 
# can be decomposed into many smaller bundles of data that can be processed independently and in parallel.
# You can also use Beam for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) tasks and pure data integration.
